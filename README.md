### Hi, my name is Daniel ðŸ‘‹

:snowflake: &emsp; I am interested in the world's cryosphere and associated natural hazards especially during the Anthropocene.

:telescope: &emsp; I use geophysical methods in particular to identify and understand key process drivers. However, I am generally eager to learn new\
 &emsp;  &emsp; strategies of collecting, analyzing and modeling environmental data.

:hammer_and_pick: &emsp; In my research, as well as in my private life, I am interested in free hardware and open software solutions to tackle whatever might\
 &emsp; &emsp; come around.

Hi, my name is Daniel ðŸ‘‹
I am interested in the world's cryosphere and associated natural hazards in the Anthropocene. As a trained geophysicist, I use geophysical methods in particular to identify and understand key process drivers. However, I am eager to learn new methods of collecting, analyzing and modeling data. In my research as well as in my private life I am interested in free hardware and open software solutions to tackle whatever might come around.

### Hi, my name is Daniel ðŸ‘‹

:snowflake: &emsp; I am interested in the world's cryosphere and associated natural hazards especially during the Anthropocene.

:telescope: &emsp; I use geophysical methods in particular to identify and understand key process drivers. However, I am generally\
&emsp; &emsp; eager to learn new strategies of collecting, analyzing and modeling environmental data.

:hammer_and_pick: &emsp; In my research, as well as in my private life, I am interested in free hardware and open software solutions to\
&emsp; &emsp; tackle whatever might come around.

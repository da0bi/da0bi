### Hi, my name is Daniel ðŸ‘‹

:snowflake: &emsp; I am interested in the world's cryosphere and associated natural hazards especially during the Anthropocene.

:telescope: &emsp; I use geophysical survey methods in particular to identify and understand key process drivers. However, I am\
&emsp; &emsp; always up for expanding my method quiver to collect, analyze and model environmental data. Want to know\
&emsp; &emsp; more about my research - check out [my Research Gate account.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Binder){:target="_blank"}

:hammer_and_pick: &emsp; Both in my research and in my private life, I am excited about free hardware and open software solutions.
